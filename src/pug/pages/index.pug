    p Available to purchase in-studio only.
    p We believe yoga should be accessible to all - regardless of income. So we offer several classes per week on a sliding scale from $15 - $22 for those who may not otherwise be able to afford our regular drop-in rates, class packages, or memberships.
    p We're happy to support our community by offering discounted classes and kindly ask that those who are in comfortable financial standing help support the health of our studio by contributing what is personally feasible so we can continue to offer community classes. Thank you!
